# IOT ENERGY TARIFF
# Overview

The IoT Energy Tariff Management System is a smart home automation project designed to control household appliances remotely while providing real-time energy consumption data. This system incorporates a live tariff meter for each appliance, an energy calculator, and a scheduler for efficient energy management.

# Features
1. Remote Appliance Control
Users can remotely control household appliances using a dedicated web or mobile interface. The system allows turning appliances on or off from anywhere, providing convenience and flexibility.

2. Live Tariff Meter
Each appliance is equipped with a live tariff meter that displays the current electricity tariff. This feature enables users to make informed decisions about appliance usage based on the current energy costs.

3. Energy Calculator
The system includes an energy calculator that measures and displays the energy consumption of each appliance in real-time. Users can track power consumption and make informed decisions to optimize energy usage.

4. Scheduler for Energy Management
A scheduler is integrated into the system, allowing users to set schedules for each appliance based on their priorities. This feature helps manage energy efficiently by running appliances during off-peak hours or based on user-defined preferences.

# Technology Stack
